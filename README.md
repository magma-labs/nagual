# Usage

## Setup

* Create a `config/configuration.yml` file with expected format and customize
* Create a `data/products.csv` file with the expected format, you can use
`data_examples/` as a reference

## Nagual Command

* Install the nagual gem
* Use the following commands:
    * `nagual review` - to validate input and see if there are invalid rows, an `error_report`
        will be generated with information about input data.
    * `nagual export` - to generate a `catalog.xml` (only valid products will be used)
* By default nagual will read from a csv and out put a catalog xml file, location of
    input and output files can be modified in `configuration.yml` file

## Nagual API

* If you rather use the gem inside your project you can use it like this:

```ruby
nagual = Nagual::API.new
puts nagual.transform(:catalog, :csv, :xml_catalog)
puts nagual.transform(:catalog, :csv, :error_report)
```

## Mapping

All valid product attributes can be mapped from a csv file using the
mapping section of the `configuration.yml` file, for that you need to
define a mutation for each expected columns:

* key: expected name in the input
* to: product field name to where values will be saved
* name: mutation name, can be either:
    * 'none' to copy the values as it is
    * 'convert' to modify the value and it has the following params:
        * default: if value is not found this value will be used
        * values: it's a map to convert a field value to another one.

In example configuration file we convert a column named status with values
'online' or 'offline' to the product field 'online_flag' with values 'true'
or 'false'

## Decoration

In ths configuration section you can add additional values or enrich the input
values with different options:

### Fixed

All products will be created with a default fixed value, key represents
the product field name to be used.

### Copy

The value from one product field will be copied as it is to another value.

* key: product field name that will be copied
* to: product field name that will be the destination

### Merge

You can use one or more input keys to generate an output pattern to be
saved in an specific product field

* keys: name of the fields to be used in pattern
* pattern: string with the expected output (keys can be used with %{} notation)
* to: name of the field that will be used to save the output

## Division

### Variation

You can create multiple products from a single entry by selecting a
variation and using that to generate new products.

Product id for each product will be generated by using the specified pattern
and also a custom attribute will be added to each product with the variation
name.

For example, if input contains an entry for `sizes` with value: `S,M` and
a `manufacturer sku` with value: `SKU`

With this configuration:

```
division:
  product:
    strategy: variation
    params:
      variations: sizes
      variation: size
      pattern: '%{manufacturer_sku}_%{size}'
```

Nagual will produce two products 2 products with the following attributes

* product id: 'SKU_S', size: 'S', manufacturer sku: SKU
* product id: 'SKU_M', size: 'M', manufacturer sku: SKU

### None

If you don't want to use this feature select 'none' strategy in configuration,
and only 1 product will be generated for each input entry.

```
division:
  product:
    strategy: none
```

## Ignore columns

If a column is not mapped in configuration file it will be ignored.

## Custom attributes

If a column is mapped but there is not product field with that name,
then a custom attribute will be generated for that value.

## Variations

To generate a new variation for products in the catalog a column needs to be
added in the csv file and then added to the `variations` section for mapping
the expected value for each row is either a comma separated list of values
or blank.

For example to set a color variation a new column will be added as
`color` and row can have values such as "blue,green" or "red"

### Variants

Variants will be automatically generated when a value for a variation is set
for a product.

The number of variants created for a product depends on how many variation
values are defined, for example if a product contains 3 different variation
values, then 9 variants will be generated, considering all the possible
combination of values.

## Images

We support 4 different types of images: `large,medium,small,swatch`

To set an image to a product, image sizes need to be listed in `images`
column of `products.csv`

The column name for images can be modified in mapping section of `configuration.yml`

And then image is expected to be located in `images` folder with this format:
`<PRODUCT_ID>_<SIZE>.png`

For example:

If we want product with id "123" to have medium and swatch images then on the
column for images in the products row, `medium,swatch` value will be added.

And then on `images` folder `123_medium.png` and `123_swatch.png` files
are expected to be present.
